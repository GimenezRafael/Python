""" experiences"
Maria has just started her undergraduate course at medical school and needs your help to
organize the experiments of a laboratory for which she is responsible. She wants to know at the end of the year,
how many guinea pigs were used in the laboratory and the percentage of each type of guinea pig used. This one
laboratory in particular uses three types of guinea pigs: frogs, mice and rabbits. to get these
information, she knows exactly the number of experiments that have been performed, the type of guinea pig
used and the number of guinea pigs used in each experiment. Write a program that reads a
integer value N that indicates the various test cases that come next. Each test case contains a
integer that represents the number of guinea pigs used and a letter ('C', 'F' or 'R'), indicating the type
guinea pig (R:Rat F:Frog R:Rabbit). Present the total number of guinea pigs used, the total of each type of
guinea pig used and the percentage of each one in relation to the total number of guinea pigs used, with the
percentage must be presented with two digits after the point.
